# Blockchain Ticket Resale Platform

## Introduction
The Blockchain Ticket Resale Platform is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Aptos blockchain that enables secure and transparent ticket resale transactions. This smart contract implements a trustless system where users can list their tickets for resale and buyers can purchase them directly using APT tokens, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the risks associated with traditional ticket resale markets.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize the secondary ticket market by:
- Eliminating fraudulent ticket sales through blockchain verification
- Providing a transparent pricing mechanism
- Reducing scalping and unfair price manipulation
- Creating a direct peer-to-peer marketplace for ticket holders
- Ensuring secure and instantaneous transactions
- Building trust between buyers and sellers through smart contract automation

## Core Features
- **Ticket Listing**: Users can list their tickets with a specified price
- **Secure Purchases**: Direct APT token transfers between buyers and sellers
- **Automated Verification**: Smart contract ensures ticket validity
- **Decentralized Operation**: No central authority or intermediary
- **Transparent Pricing**: All listing prices are public on the blockchain

## Technical Implementation
The smart contract consists of two main functions:
1. `list_ticket`: Allows ticket holders to create new listings
2. `purchase_ticket`: Enables direct purchase of listed tickets

## Future Goals
1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 3-6 months)
   - Implement ticket transfer restrictions
   - Add event metadata storage
   - Include price history tracking
   - Develop a frontend interface

2. **Medium-term Goals** (6-12 months)
   - Integration with major event platforms
   - Mobile app development
   - Multi-token payment support
   - Dynamic pricing mechanisms

3. **Long-term Vision** (1-2 years)
   - Cross-chain ticket transfer functionality
   - AI-powered price recommendations
   - Event organizer collaboration tools
   - Global marketplace expansion

2. Ensure you have sufficient APT tokens
3. Call the appropriate function (`list_ticket` or `purchase_ticket`)

## Security Considerations

- Verify ticket details before purchase
- Only interact with the official contract address
- Keep your private keys secure
